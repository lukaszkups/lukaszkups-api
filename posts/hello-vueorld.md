# Hello Vue'orld!

I've finally switched to Vue.js-powered website template.

WTF? SPA as a mostly static website? R U nuts?

Nope, it's because I just can :P

And I just wanted to test some stuff Vue.js-related. I really don't care about SEO of this website, because 99% of the traffic goes from my direct social-media links ;)

I'll be very thankful if You'll send me some feedback about overall feeling about it (or report bugs :D ) - there You have an [official repo](http://github.com/lukaszkups/lukaszkups-vue).

Cheers!
